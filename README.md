Role Of Machine Learning In Detection Of Breast Cancer


A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.

Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70. But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.

Now while its difficult to figure out for physicians by seeing only images of x-ray that weather the tumor is toxic or not training a machine learning model according to the identification of tumour can be of great help.


Project Description


The Projects Features Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning. It has been tested that while there exists several machine learning models,Support Vector Machine or SVM in short is reported to have highest accuracy of (approximately 97%) in detecting breast cancer.

The dataset used in this project is from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, however it can be directly accessed from Scikit learn library's collection of datasets as...

sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer


RESULTS



An accuracy of 95% was achieved by using SVM model and after normalization technique after optimisation of C and Gamma parameters it was increased to a value of a 96%.
